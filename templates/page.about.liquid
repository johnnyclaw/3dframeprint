  <p>We started 3D Frame Print with a simple belief: your art deserves a frame as unique as the work it holds. Mass-produced frames are generic, fragile, and wasteful. We knew there had to be a better way.</p>

  <p>Using precision 3D printing technology, we craft each frame to order. No warehouses full of inventory. No cookie-cutter sizes. Just clean, geometric frames printed with care — in the exact dimensions and colors you need.</p>

      <h3>The Craft</h3>
      <p>Every frame is designed in-house and printed layer by layer using premium PLA filament. The result is a frame with clean lines, precise angles, and a modern matte finish that complements any artwork.</p>

      <h3>The Technology</h3>
      <p>We use FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printing — the same technology used in aerospace and industrial design. Each frame goes through quality control to ensure dimensional accuracy within 0.2mm.</p>

      <h3>Sustainability</h3>
      <p>Made on demand means zero excess inventory. Our PLA filament is derived from renewable resources like corn starch. We ship in recyclable packaging. Less waste at every step.</p>
